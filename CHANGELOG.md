## v0.0.11 — M2 foundation: initial schema, DB layer, and integration tests

### Added
- Initial migration `migrations/0001_init.sql` for:
  - `agents`, `users`, `runs`, `steps`, `artifacts`, `action_requests`, `action_results`, `audit_events`
- `core` DB access module in `core/src/db.rs` with minimal persistence APIs:
  - `create_run`

- Updated developer/testing docs for DB integration test execution:
  - `DEVELOPMENT.md`
  - `TESTING.md`
- Updated `docs/ROADMAP.md` with an explicit channel-communications milestone:
  - White Noise first-class messaging connector
  - Slack enterprise-secondary connector

## v0.0.10 — Nostr-first communications: White Noise first-class, Slack secondary

### Added
- `docs/ADR/ADR-0005-nostr-first-whitenoise.md` to formalize messaging priority and connector order.

### Changed
- Updated docs to make White Noise (Marmot over Nostr) the primary messaging path:
  - `README.md`

  - `docs/ROADMAP.md`

## v0.0.9 — Add contributor and operator docs

### Added
- `DEVELOPMENT.md`:
  - local dev prerequisites and bootstrap
  - shared-Postgres local workflow
  - build/test/migration commands
  - contributor workflow expectations
- `OPERATIONS.md`:
  - deployment topology for shared Postgres per environment
  - runtime safety controls and incident actions
  - DB operations and observability guidance
  - release/change-management checkpoints

### Changed
- Updated docs index in `README.md` to include `DEVELOPMENT.md` and `OPERATIONS.md`.

## v0.0.8 — M1 core contracts: capability and policy engine with tests

### Changed
- Replaced `core` placeholder implementation with reusable policy contracts:
  - `CapabilityKind`, `CapabilityGrant`, `CapabilityLimits`, `GrantSet`
  - `ActionRequest`, `PolicyDecision`, `DenyReason`
  - `is_action_allowed` default-deny evaluator with scoped capability matching and payload limit checks
- Added required `core` policy unit tests for:
  - unknown action type deny
  - missing capability deny
  - scope mismatch deny
  - payload limit deny
  - exact capability+scope allow
  - stable deny reason strings

## v0.0.7 — Add delivery roadmap with milestones and exit criteria

### Added
- `docs/ROADMAP.md` with milestone-based delivery plan (M1-M9), landmarks, and explicit exit criteria.

### Changed
- Added `docs/ROADMAP.md` to documentation index in `README.md`.

## v0.0.6 — Commit Cargo.lock for reproducible workspace builds

### Changed
- Added `Cargo.lock` to version control for deterministic dependency resolution across local/CI builds.

## v0.0.5 — Shared schema topology documented across architecture and ops docs

### Changed
- Documented shared Postgres topology across docs:
  - One Postgres cluster per environment.
  - One standardized app schema per environment (not per-agent DB/schema).
  - Direct Postgres access limited to `api`/`worker`; agents/skills use platform APIs/protocols.
- Updated the following docs accordingly:
  - `README.md`
  - `ARCHITECTURE.md`
  - `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
  - `docs/MVP_PLAN.md`
  - `docs/RUNBOOK.md`
  - `docs/SCHEMA.md`

## v0.0.4 — Schema docs: first-class agent/user linkage

### Changed
- Updated `docs/SCHEMA.md` to model enterprise attribution explicitly:
  - Added `agents` and `users` tables.
  - Added `agent_id`/`user_id` linkage fields to `runs`, `steps`, and `audit_events`.
  - Added indexes for common tenant+agent and tenant+user query paths.

## v0.0.3 — Shared Postgres topology ADR + architecture doc link cleanup

### Added
- `docs/ADR/ADR-0004-shared-postgres-topology.md`:
  - One shared Postgres cluster per environment, not one instance per agent.
  - Standardized app schema for platform tables.
  - API/worker services are the only DB clients; agents/skills do not connect directly to Postgres.

### Changed
- Fixed stale protocol-spec references in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` to use `docs/agent_platform.md`.

## v0.0.2 — Repo skeleton + sqlx workspace scaffolding + testing standards

### Added
- Repository skeleton ZIP (ready-to-unzip into a new repo) containing:
  - Rust workspace directories: `api/`, `worker/`, `core/`, `skillrunner/`
  - Minimal crate stubs (`src/main.rs` / `src/lib.rs`) so `cargo test` can run immediately
  - Root `Cargo.toml` workspace with shared dependencies (Tokio, Axum, sqlx, serde, uuid, time, tracing)
  - Crate `Cargo.toml` files for `api`, `worker`, `core`, `skillrunner`
- SQLx-oriented developer tooling:
  - `Makefile` targets for `migrate` and `sqlx-prepare` (offline metadata workflow)
  - `rust-toolchain.toml` to standardize toolchain + fmt/clippy components
- Local development infrastructure:
  - `docker-compose.yml` for Postgres dev DB
  - `.gitignore` and `.editorconfig`
- CI defaults:
  - `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (fmt, clippy with `-D warnings`, test)
- Project governance/quality docs:
  - `TESTING.md` (tests-as-you-go rules, unit vs integration, DB isolation strategy, timeouts/limits)
  - `CHANGELOG.md` updated to track docs + scaffolding evolution

### Notes
- Clarified that multi-node/cluster deployments should use a shared Postgres service for durable state (runs/steps/audit), rather than per-node bundled databases.

## v0.0.1 — Initial docs + MVP scaffolding plan

### Added
- Core product/architecture documentation:
  - `docs/agent_platform.md` (platform brief + Skill Protocol v0)
  - `ARCHITECTURE.md` (system architecture + MVP definition)
- Codex guidance and guardrails:
  - `AGENTS.md` (repo instructions + non-negotiables)
- Security documentation:
  - `SECURITY.md` (security posture + forbidden patterns + deployment minimums)
  - `docs/THREAT_MODEL.md` (MVP-first threat model)
  - `docs/POLICY.md` (capability model + default-deny policy + example grants)
- Operational documentation:
  - `docs/RUNBOOK.md` (MVP run/ops notes)
  - `docs/API.md` (MVP API sketch)
- Decision records:
  - `docs/ADR/ADR-0001-out-of-process-skills.md`
  - `docs/ADR/ADR-0002-ndjson-protocol-v0.md`
  - `docs/ADR/ADR-0003-no-general-http-in-mvp.md`
- MVP implementation guidance:
  - `docs/MVP_PLAN.md` (vertical slice checklist + acceptance criteria + required tests)
  - `docs/SCHEMA.md` (MVP Postgres schema outline)
- Testing policy:
  - `TESTING.md` (unit vs integration test requirements, DB isolation strategy, timeouts/limits, “tests-as-you-go” rules)

### Notes
- MVP scope explicitly defers:
  - general `http.request` primitive (or requires strict single-host allowlist)
  - multi-tenancy
  - marketplace/signing beyond curated installs
  - microVM isolation (Firecracker/Kata)
  - UI
