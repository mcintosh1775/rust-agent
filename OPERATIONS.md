# Operations Guide

This is a living document for deploying and operating Aegis.

## Scope
- Service topology
- Runtime operations and safety controls
- Incident handling and maintenance checkpoints

## Production topology (baseline)
- `api` service (control plane)
- `worker` service (data plane)
- Shared Postgres cluster per environment (`dev`, `staging`, `prod`)
- Optional object store for artifacts

Rules:
- Use one standardized app schema per environment (for example `aegis`).
- Do not create Postgres instances or schemas per agent as a default model.
- Only `api` and `worker` connect to Postgres directly.
- Skills and agents interact through platform APIs/protocols only.

## Security baseline
- API behind TLS reverse proxy.
- Private network access from `api`/`worker` to Postgres.
- Worker/skill runtime outbound egress deny-by-default.
- Secrets in Vault/KMS, never exposed to skills.
- Structured logs with redaction.

## Core operational controls
- Disable external actions by policy when needed (`message.send`, `http.request`).
- Scale workers to zero to halt execution safely.
- Rotate credentials if exfiltration is suspected.
- Preserve append-only audit trails for investigations.

## Database operations
- Migration ownership: platform migrations manage schema lifecycle.
- Backup strategy: scheduled base backups + WAL archiving (or managed equivalent).
- Restore drill: rehearse point-in-time restore in staging on a schedule.
- Capacity: use connection pooling and monitor saturation indicators.

## Observability
- Metrics:
  - run/step latency
  - action allow/deny and execution status
  - skill failures/timeouts
  - worker queue depth
- Traces:
  - per-run spans across API -> worker -> action execution
- Logs:
  - structured JSON with correlation IDs (`run_id`, `step_id`, `action_request_id`)

## Release and change management
- Keep releases small and tagged.
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` for each release.
- Apply migrations before or with compatible service rollout.
- Validate rollback paths for both service binaries and schema changes.

## End-user support basics
- Expose run status and audit retrieval endpoints for support workflows.
- Document allowed capability bundles for common recipes.
- Keep clear operator playbooks for deny-by-default policy overrides.
